# DNA Sequence Analyzer

A bioinformatics tool for analyzing DNA sequences, performing global and local alignments, calculating nucleotide percentages, and classifying sequences based on alignment scores. The tool also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, and users can save the results in an Excel file.

## Features

- **DNA Sequence Analysis**: Load DNA sequences from FASTA files and calculate nucleotide percentages (A, T, G, C, and CG).
- **Sequence Alignment**: Perform global and local alignment of DNA sequences using Biopython's `pairwise2`.
- **Classification**: Classify sequences based on their alignment score using a customizable threshold.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive GUI built using Tkinter for easy interaction with the tool.
- **Save Results**: Save alignment scores, nucleotide percentages, and classifications to an Excel file.
